## Usage
When the user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, then they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When the user clicks on the Save icon, then the new note they have entered is saved, and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column. When the user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When the user clicks on the trashcan icon beside each saved note, then that note is deleted from the list.
